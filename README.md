pinger
======

This program is meant to aid in automating verification testing.  Today, this supports onePK by using CPAL, but it idea could easily be ported to use any API or even SSH.  Next steps would be to loop through any number of source routers to test connectivity to all of the destinations and store contents in a file.  Then parse the file to see which destinations are failing.

Sample output when running this:


cisco@onepk:~/apps/pinger$ python pinger.py
